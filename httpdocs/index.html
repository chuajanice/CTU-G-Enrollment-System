    <h2>Discover CTU Ginatilan through our 3-D campus model</h2>

    <p>
        Step into the future of learning with our fully rendered 3-D representation of CTU Ginatilan Campus. 
        This interactive model allows you to explore the campus — from its modern multi-storey building 
        to classroom layouts and campus grounds — giving you a realistic preview of student life and 
        facilities even before you set foot on campus.
    </p>

    <h3>A campus built for growth and opportunity</h3>
    <p>
        Since its establishment in 2018, CTU Ginatilan has grown steadily, offering quality programs such 
        as BS Information Technology and BS Industrial Technology (Computer Technology). In 2020–2021, 
        a new 3-storey building with multiple classrooms was donated to the campus, reflecting the commitment 
        of our partners and the community to expand and enhance learning facilities.
    </p>

    <p>
        The 3-D model captures this milestone in vivid detail — showing a well-designed structure that blends 
        functional classrooms with inspiring spaces for academic growth.
    </p>

    <h3>Envision yourself as part of our community</h3>
    <p>
        By navigating the 3-D model, you can imagine yourself attending classes, collaborating with classmates, 
        and immersing in campus life. More than just a building, this campus stands as a symbol of ambition — 
        a place where students from Southwest Cebu can access technology-rich education and forge pathways 
        toward future careers.
    </p>
